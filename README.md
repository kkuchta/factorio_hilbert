# Generating Hilbert Curves in Factorio

[Hilbert Curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) are these neat-looking, space-filling lines in math.

[Factorio](https://factorio.com/) is a pretty great video game where you build factories. You can use "blueprints" in the game, which are pre-made sets of buildings and entities. You can import blueprints into the game via a "blueprint string" which is actually just a bunch of json in a trenchoat.

This repo is a few scripts I put together to generate a factorio blueprint string for a hilbert curve made out of conveyor belts because I thought it'd look cool.

Also present is a lua script that I put together so I could record the curve in action.
